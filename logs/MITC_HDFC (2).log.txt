PROMPT_VERSION: v1.3
THIS IS A HDFC HOME-LOAN MITC DOCUMENT.

You are completing a loan document analysis. Advanced rule-based extraction has already found most terms, but these HARD-TO-FIND terms are still MISSING:

fees_and_charges: administrative_fee, legal_charges, valuation_charges
prepayment_and_foreclosure: foreclosure_charges, lock_in_period
interest_rates: reset_frequency
documents: kyc_documents
grievance: complaint_procedure, customer_service

FOCUS ONLY on these specific missing terms. Our rules now handle common patterns, so look for:

DIFFICULT PATTERNS TO FIND:

PENAL CHARGES & LATE PAYMENTS:
- Look for: "Penal interest @ 2% p.a. over EBR", "Late payment charge: 2% p.a.", "Default interest rate: 2% over applicable rate"
- Bounce charges: "Bounce charge: Rs.500", "Returned cheque charges"
- Penal interest rates: Often buried in fine print or penalty sections

TIERED LTV RATIOS:
- Look for: "Loan-to-Value Ratio: Up to 90% for loans up to Rs.30 Lakhs", "LTV: Up to 80% for loans up to Rs.50 Lakhs"
- Table format: "90% - Up to Rs.30 Lakhs", "80% - Up to Rs.50 Lakhs", "75% - Above Rs.50 Lakhs"
- Maximum LTV: "Maximum LTV: 90% for loans up to Rs.30 Lakhs"

INSURANCE & SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Insurance coverage: "Insurance coverage: Rs.5 Lakhs minimum", "Life insurance: Mandatory"
- Property insurance: "Property insurance: As per bank's requirement", "Fire insurance: Compulsory"
- Primary security: "Primary security: Property mortgage", "Security: Equitable mortgage"

SPECIAL ELIGIBILITY CATEGORIES:
- NRI: "NRI: Eligible with additional documentation", "Non-Resident Indian: Special rates"
- Defense personnel: "Defense personnel: Special rates available", "Armed forces: Concessional rates"
- Government employees: "Government employees: Concessional rates", "Public sector: Special rates"

COMPOUND FEES:
- Look for: "1.50% or Rs.4,500 whichever is higher", "2% or Rs.5,000 whichever is lower"
- Processing fees with minimum/maximum: "0.50% to 3.00% (min Rs.2,000, max Rs.10,000)"

FEES & CHARGES:
- Administrative fees: Often in fine print as "Admin fee", "Documentation charges", or in tariff schedules
- Legal/Valuation charges: May be listed as "As applicable", "As per actuals", or ranges
- Template fields: Look for "___", "[ ]", blank spaces after fee names

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
- Income requirements: "Net monthly income", "Salary requirement", "Income criteria"
- CIBIL score: May be stated as "Credit score", "Credit rating", "Score requirement"
- Age limits: "Age criteria", "Maximum/Minimum age", "Age at loan maturity"
- Employment: "Service requirement", "Experience needed", "Employment criteria"

DOCUMENTS REQUIRED:
- Income proof: "Salary slips", "Income documents", "ITR", "Form 16"
- Identity/Address: "KYC documents", "ID proof", "Address proof"
- Property papers: "Sale deed", "NOC", "Approved plans"

GRIEVANCE & SUPPORT:
- Contact details: Phone numbers, email IDs, website URLs
- Escalation process: "Level 1", "Level 2", "Ombudsman", "Senior Manager"
- Timeline: "7 days", "15 days", response time commitments

ENHANCED EXTRACTION STRATEGY:
BANK-SPECIFIC: Extract individual vs non-individual prepayment rules and lock-in nuances.

- Check TABLES and SCHEDULES for fee structures and LTV bands
- Look in APPENDICES and separate sections for document lists
- Scan for NUMERICAL VALUES (age limits, income thresholds, percentages)
- Find CONTACT INFORMATION (phone, email, branch details)
- Look for POLICY STATEMENTS with specific criteria
- Check FOOTNOTES and small print sections
- Search for CLAUSE REFERENCES that might contain details
- Look for PENALTY SECTIONS and INSURANCE CLAUSES
- Check for SPECIAL CATEGORY MENTIONS (NRI, defense, government)

TEMPLATE HANDLING:
- If fields are blank ("___", "[ ]", empty spaces), return "Template field - value not specified"
- If values say "As applicable" or "As per actuals", include that exact text
- If ranges are given ("18 to 70 years"), extract the full range
